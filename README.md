# Image processing program : From Pixel to Character

Hippolyte Petitjean is a French painter whose wife, Louise-Claire Chardon, was the subject of his
"Jeune Femme Assise" painting (see https://fr.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fichier:Hippolyte_Petitjean-Jeune_femme_assise-Musée_des_beaux-arts_de_Nancy.jpg). 
His style of painting was the spark that led to this image processing program, visible with the AdaptivePixellation method.

## Overview
This Java program allows you to create an image from a source image. The output image is composed of characters instead of pixels,
whose averaged brightness corresponds to the pixel brighness of the original image.

## Features
- **Imagegenerator**: Classic processing method
- **AdaptiveGenerator**: Creates an image with some zones with the same pixel values grouped.

## Usage
